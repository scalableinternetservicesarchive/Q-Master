# Q-master


## Overview
----
Q-master is a quora-style, question-and-answer site where all kinds of questions are asked, answered, edited, and organized by its community of users in the form of opinions. 

It is highly interactive with best responses upvoted by others in the following methods:

Answer recommendations:
1.Ask to Answer: This feature enables the user to request another user's answer to a question that they feel is fit or better suited to answer that question.
2.Search for related questions: Several tags which describe each question will generate automaticly when users post their questions. This tags will help the user navigate through the questions and find what is more relevant to their preference.
3.Recommendations: In this method, we will track the history of users searching, and recommend questions based on their preferences. This will lead to the user either answering that question or refers another user to better answer it.

Content moderation:
1.Upvote/Downvote: Users can rank answers based on how relevant or helpful they found the answers to be. This feature helps maintain the quality of content posted online.The more upvotes an answer receives, the higher it is ranked, and it shows up on top of the searches related to the question. If an answer is ranked poorly, it is “collapsed” and will not show up in people’s feeds.
